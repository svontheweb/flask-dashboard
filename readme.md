Python Developer Assignment
Create a Python App using flask/django which should perform the functions mentioned below:
 It should have an upload option which accepts .csv or .xlsx files.
 The uploaded files should be saved in a folder.
 There should be an admin panel option which can logged in via admin login with creds:
Username: admin and password: admin. (So, no need for a database)
 The admin panel should show a table record of all the files uploaded.
 There should be two buttons for each file: 1. To Download the file | 2. To Open the File.
 Example:
S.No File Action
1 Data1.csv Open Download

2 Data2.xlsx Open Downlaod

 On Download, The File should be downloaded.
 On Open, Read the Data inside the file using Pandas or any other package and render it as a
table.

Zip all the contents of a folder and mail it back. (There is no need for database connection for
this project but you should have the knowledge of using flask-mysql/python mysql etc.)
